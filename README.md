# Projects
A repository for projects I have done.

£Curl Counter
Curl Counter is a Python program that utilizes your webcam to monitor and analyze your bicep curl performance. It counts the number of curls you complete and measures the time spent in the up and down positions. A curl is counted when your arm moves from a curled position to an almost straight arm. This program was developed to help track the number of curls performed and the duration in each position.

£Language Learner by Speech
Language Learner by Speech is a Python application that leverages the computer's default text-to-speech function (in English) and a downloaded speech-to-text module (Spanish - Helena). It prompts you to repeat a word in Spanish, and if your pronunciation matches the expected output, it responds with "Well done." Otherwise, it prompts you to try again. This project is a work in progress and has some known issues, such as the need for Spanish text-to-speech for certain sentences or words and improvements needed in the error-handling loop.

£Text to Speech Website
The Text to Speech Website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a text box where users can input text and control playback with options to play, pause, resume, and restart the text. Users can also select different voices. Currently, the download button is non-functional as I am working on enabling sound file downloads from the browser.

£Bank Management System
The Bank Management System is a simple banking application developed in C. It allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and transfer funds. There is potential for enhancement by adding more features to the banking system.
