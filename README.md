# Projects
A repository for projects I have done.

Curl Counter is a python program which uses your webcam to monitor your bicep curl progress by counting the time the curl position is up and down and well as keeping count of how many curls you do. The curl is counted when the arm goes to a curl position then down to an almost straight arm. I created this to help me keep track of how many curls I do and how long I keep it in each position.

Language Learner by speech is a python program which uses the computers default text to speech in (english) and an downloaded speech to text (spanish - Helena) to ask you to repeat a word after it and you have to say it back. If what you say matches what is asked it 'Well done' or if you are wrong it says try again. This is a work in progress which has some faults such as the text to speech will have to be spanish for sentences or particular words and the loop system after you get it wrong needs to be worked on.
