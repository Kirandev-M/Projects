A repository for projects I have done.

Curl Counter is a python program which uses your webcam to monitor your bicep curl progress by counting the time the curl position is up and down and well as keeping count of how many curls you do. The curl is counted when the arm goes to a curl position then down to an almost straight arm. I created this to help me keep track of how many curls I do and how long I keep it in each position.
